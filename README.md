# SiemensS7-motion-control-hmi
In this project I use a Siemens servo motor to move an axis.
The servo motor can be controlled with with three different ways.

Move with velocity: controlling with a constant velocity forward or backward.

Relative move: controlling with a value forward or backward from the previous position to the new position.

Absolute move: controlling forward or backward to a certain position.
