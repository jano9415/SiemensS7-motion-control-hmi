# SiemensS7-motion-control-hmi
In this project I use a Siemens servo motor to move an axis.
The servo motor can be controlled manually in five different ways.

Home: controlling to the home position.

Jog: controlling forward or backward while pushing the button Jog+ or Jog-

Move with velocity: controlling with a constant velocity forward or backward.

Relative move: controlling with a value forward or backward from the previous position to the new position.

Absolute move: controlling forward or backward to a certain position.

The position of axis is 0:

The axis moves forward with velocity 18:

The axis moves from home position to position 164 after typing 164 in the absolute input field and clicking Absolute ON button:

The axis moves from position 164 to position 146 after typing -20 in the relative input field and clicking the Relative ON button:

Automatic mode:

There is Sensor1 to detect the product on the conveyor and Cylinder1 attached to the axis to grab the product.7
